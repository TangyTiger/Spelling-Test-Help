# Spelling-Test-Help


HELLO!!!!

I know how annoyong studying spelling tests can be so this program is one that will read out all your list words and help you study!

Before running this program, make sure you have Python installed and write "pip install pyttsx3" on Windows CMD or "pip3 install pyttsx3" on Mac or Linux terminal.

Then, it's simple, in spellinglist.txt, write down each word in its new line. And at the very end of the code, make a new line so that your typing cursor is in its own line. 

After that just run "main.py" and its Happy Learning!!!
